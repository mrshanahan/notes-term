TODO:
- Open "notes" to something with a specific title
    o Should just open neovim to the right file for now,
      but exit should go to main notes screen
- Handle neovim bad exit more gracefully, e.g. if file is
  already open
- SEARCH!
- Scrolling with multiple items
- Stop panicking
- Only redraw modified parts of screen
- Experiment with "overridden" methods
- Redraw on zoom in/out (i.e. on terminal size change)
- Import text
